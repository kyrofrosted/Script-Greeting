# Greeting Script with Weather and Daily Messages

## Overview

This project is a Lua script for Roblox games that provides a personalized greeting message to the player (ONLY works in Kohls Admin House [https://www.roblox.com/games/112420803/Kohls-Admin-House-NBC-Updated]). The greeting includes the current weather in a specified city, a daily message (quote, compliment, or fun fact), and advice based on the weather condition. The script utilizes the Weather API to fetch real-time weather data and delivers a unique and engaging experience for players.

## Features

- **Personalized Greetings**: The script greets the player based on the time of day (Morning, Afternoon, Night).
- **Weather Integration**: Fetches current weather data for a specified city using the Weather API.
- **Daily Messages**: Provides a random daily message, which can be a quote, compliment, or fun fact.
- **Weather Advice**: Offers advice based on the current weather condition.
- **Caching Mechanism**: Utilizes a caching mechanism to avoid frequent API calls and improve performance.
